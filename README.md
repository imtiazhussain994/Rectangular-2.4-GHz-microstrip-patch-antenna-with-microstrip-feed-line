The antenna consists of a thin metallic patch (the radiating element) on a dielectric substrate (using FR4 material) backed by a ground plane. Therefore, to design a 2.4 GHz band Wi-Fi antenna there are several crucial factors: Substrate Material and Thickness, Patch Dimensions, Feed Line Dimensions Placement and Ground Plane Size, etc.
